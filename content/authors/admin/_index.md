I'm a second year PhD student at MIT Sloan School of Management. I am interested in the cognitive processes underlying the belief and spread of misinformation, and my research examines the efficacy of different interventions in quelling dissemination of false information. My research also investigates political psychology and behavior on social media platforms. I use a variety of methodological approaches from cognitive and social psychology, behavioral economics, and computational social science. My work is supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship.

One day, I aspire to open up a small waterfront cafÃ© in a college town, named 'Pier ReView.' ðŸ˜Š
